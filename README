Welcome, one and all!

I'll keep this brief.  There are loads of Project Euler solution-sets out there, but I've tended to see a disturbing lack of them with proper documentation / help for people who desire to _learn_ about the solutions, rather than simply solving them.
This project aims to (help) resolve that lack.

I do not claim to have the most optimal code.  I do not expect to have the most optimal code.
I am not interested in witty "one-liners" which obscure the process.  This is primarily for _learning_, not minimum size.
There's quite a way to go, but ultimately, I hope to solve a fair number, research others, cheat a bit to find others' solutions, and learn a ridiculous amount in the process.  You're welcome to join in the ride.
Don't see a language listed?  Contribute!  I'll add what I know, and I like using these to help understand a new language, but I obviously cannot learn them all.


I will generally discourage adding images, as they take up a lot of space and do not version properly.  Consider simplistic SVG, or off-site hosting, or something like "dot" notation for graphs (more info here: http://www.graphviz.org/ (if you know of a better site / notation, let me know!)).


Style guidelines:
	Use tabs.  They're flexible, spaces aren't.  I don't really care if your compiler doesn't like tabs, unless it's a multiple-OS issue, you should probably consider switching compilers if it has trouble with something so elementary.
	Readability is paramount.  If there's a built-in method that's efficient, use it, but don't add unnecessary complexity to solve 5 problems in less code.  Each should be solved in stand-alone ways that can be approached without knowledge of other solutions covered in this repo.
	Where you have more than one solution, include them ALL in the same source code file.  Reduce all problems to a single function call, and call all the solutions in whatever location that language will first run. (ie, main() in C-like, or just in the file in Ruby).
	Try to avoid OS-specific code.  Allowances are made for heavily OS-supported systems like Cocoa and .NET (though I dislike .NET, personally).  No calling Windows-specific C libraries, in other words.  Absolutely everything needed to handle all solutions should be included, with the obvious exception of the compilers / runtimes for the languages (and each folder should have a quick README for installing that language on a number of OSes, or at least links to get started).
	English.  Only.  And expect your text to be heavily modified if you have excessively poor grammar.



That's good for now.  Anyone who sees this: enjoy!
