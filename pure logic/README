As the folder suggests, this is for solving problems with "pure logic".  There are a fair number of cases on Project Euler where simple logic will out-perform a computer brute-forcing the problem.

I respectfully request that explanations be relatively approachable by newbies, though I understand that may not be the case.  Still, link to good explanations if you don't explain yourself, and assume the reader has only simple algebra / logic skills.
