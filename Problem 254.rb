  Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

  Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

  Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.

  Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

  Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and â€‰sg(i) for 1  i  20 is 156.

  What is sum(sg(i)) for 1<=i<=150?

=begin
  inefficient, methods of speeding up:
    1) cache results (quickly increases, appears exponential, ~100k to 150k+ at around 35-40)
    2) pre-filter results.  Same digits / equivalent digits result in same output
      ie, sf(1000) == sf(1), sf(222) == sf(3)
  
  Idea: hash / large array of results.  On lookup of sf(n), check a[n].  If exists, smallest is known.  If not, fill.  DO THIS AFTER PRE-FILTERING.
=end

=begin
  Prefiltering scheme:
    Sort by smallest num first (13,14,etc)
    Drop all zeros (100 == 1)
    Numbering: remember, sf(n) == sum of digits of sum of factorials, so any digits that can be expressed in fewer digits are equivalent
      11     == 2
      222    == 3
      3333   == 4
      etc... prev digit digit-plus-1-times == next digit
