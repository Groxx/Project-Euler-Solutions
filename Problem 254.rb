  Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

  Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

  Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.

  Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

  Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and â€‰sg(i) for 1 <= i <= 20 is 156.

  What is sum(sg(i)) for 1<=i<=150?

def g(n)
=begin
  inefficient, methods of speeding up:
    1) cache results (quickly increases, appears exponential, ~100k to 150k+ at around 35-40)
    2) pre-filter results.  Same digits / equivalent digits result in same output
      ie, sf(1000) == sf(1), sf(222) == sf(3)
  
  Idea: hash / large array of results.  On lookup of sf(n), check a[n].  If exists, smallest is known.  If not, fill.  DO THIS AFTER PRE-FILTERING.
=end

=begin
  Prefiltering scheme:
    Sort by smallest num first (13,14,etc)
    Drop all zeros (100 == 1)
    Numbering: remember, sf(n) == sum of digits of sum of factorials, so any digits that can be expressed in fewer digits are equivalent
      11     == 2
      222    == 3
      3333   == 4
      etc... prev digit digit-plus-1-times == next digit
=end

=begin
  Prefiltering scheme above didn't work, fairly significantly slower than regular, still too slow.
    Perhaps simply stripping 0s (and 1s?) will work quickly enough?

  Replacing zeros (and after) with ones slows down process.  Need something faster, or write in C.
