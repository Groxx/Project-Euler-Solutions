  Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.

  Define sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.

  Define g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.

  Define sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.

  Further, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and â€‰sg(i) for 1  i  20 is 156.

  What is sum(sg(i)) for 1<=i<=150?
