Java installation:
	Eclipse is the 700-pound-gorilla of Java development, but it is decent.
		Available at: http://www.eclipse.org

Java specific notes:
	Java has a large amount of highly-abstracted tools built-in.  If you use them, be sure to include an explanation, and attempt to solve the problem without them, where able / feasible.
