Objective-C installation:
	On OSX: install the Developer Tools that came with your OSX installation disk.  Usually on a second disk.
	On anything else: GCC will do for you. http://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html
		Note that non-OSX-Developer-Tools will not have Objective-C 2.0 features, nor the garbage collector.

Objective-C specific notes:
	Most Obj-C code should be written with the Cocoa libraries.  Start a separate set of files if using "pure", non-platform-specific Obj-C.
